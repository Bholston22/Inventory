# Inventory
Developed a Python notebook for a straightforward inventory management system. This code facilitates the input of initial inventory quantities and tracks sales by allowing users to input the number of items sold. The program then computes the updated inventory levels, providing a quick overview of stock changes. The code is designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy input and displaying clear calculations. This simplified inventory system is suitable for basic inventory tracking needs and serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental inventory management concepts in a Python notebook environment. There is a lot of room for improvement to this code. Future add ons such as it being able to store this information for you and have more than just "shoes" as its item.
